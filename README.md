# DataLibrarianScripts
A few scripts to workaround library data - one example is exporting bibxml files from i.e. Mendeley export and having an output in *.CSV format - by specific fields.

This repository contains (eventually ) several scripts on how to read/write and convert between BibTex and CSV files, comparing two csv files and visualising them.
